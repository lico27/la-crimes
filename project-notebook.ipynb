    "Real-world interventions can be based on the predictions of the model. For example, if the model predicts that there is a high risk level for Black children being victimised in Central LA during weekday evenings, a local youth centre could implement targeted outreach programmes during those hours â€” offering safe spaces, support services, or structured activities."

This decision was made with sensitivity and recognition that different Asian subgroups â€” such as Indian, Vietnamese, Korean - have distinct cultural/socioeconomic backgrounds (UK Gov, 2020). For another type of project, this aggregration would potentially be inappropriate, but I deemed that grouping was most suitable to ensure the robustness of my model and avoid overly granular categories that could lead to unreliable output."

    "There are 319 premises types, with very little possibility for grouping using the same methods as above, as the vast majority have unique names with few repeating words. As such, I decided to use semantic similarity clustering to create meaningful categories for the model. I used a sentence transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to group premises types into 12 predefined categories. The model did an acceptable job, but I followed up the clustering with manual corrections to ensure that the final groupings were logical and appropriate. I used the same keyword function as I did to categorise `crime_type`, which allowed me to retain human oversight whilst saving time."

    "- Noted that 2390 rows have 0.0 for lon and lat. Will keep as `area` will be used for location. Visualisations (i.e. heatmap) will still be useful as this is only 0.1% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demographic Factors:**\n",
    "- More girls were victimised than other genders. This is true across all age groups, but is more pronounced for teenage girls. There doesn't appear to be a major difference between the sexes in temporal terms. Twice as many girls than boys were victimised in a private residence.\n",
    "- Hispanic/Latin/Mexican is the demographic most likely to be victimised at 62%. This group represents 47% of City of LA's population.\n",
    "- Overall, white people are the second most victimised group but Black children are the second most victimised group of children.\n",
    "- The number of children victimised at each age steadily increases by c. 1000 each year until the age of 10, after which it excelerates by c. 2000 each year. (or something to that effect)\n",
    "- From the visualisation, it appears that the proportion of each descent group does not substantially differ across ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Factors:**\n",
    "- Month year is surprising as there is a dip in July, which goes against other findings in Criminological research. Could be attributed to a successful programme \"Summer Night Lights\" in LA. Graph shows that child victimisation in July has decreased since 2010. But I think I will not use this as a feature as I think a more granular approach will be more insightful.\n",
    "- There are two peaks during the day that are likely to be attributable to the time when childen are travelling to/from school (8am and 3pm) - when they are in public, on transport, moving between home and school, potentially unsupervised by adults. These peaks are not noticeable upon removing the `is_child` filter. There is also an enormous peak in the middle of the day, which is almost certainly due to officers logging a crime at midday when the actual time is not known, or due to legacy errors created as historical records have been digitised or transferred to new systems (src FBI).\n",
    "- To deal with the 12pm peak, I considered taking the advice of the FBI book and removing all 12pm. But it would be very unwise to have a 12pm \"safe spot\" where no crimes happen. So I calculated the average of 11am and 1pm to gauge how many crimes would reasonably be expected at 12pm. I retained this number of 12pm instances, but converted the remainder to NaN. I was then able to conduct hot deck imputation on the \"missing\" data which neutralised the 12pm peak that was due to concentration bias.\n",
    "- There is a peak in victimisation on Fridays, but it may not be significant.\n",
    "- I will not use \"day of month\" as a feature as it appears that there is a huge influx of crimes being logged on the first of the month. 200% more crimes logged on this day than the next most busy - the 15th of the month, which again maybe due to officers choosing the middle of the month if the exact day is unknown. In future it may be useful to look at date_rptd as well as date, because that may be a more reliable measure of fluctuations in crime over time. I think it is okay not to consider day of month, as it is less likely to have an impact on victimisation than other temporal fluctuations (e.g. day of week and time of day).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Factors:**\n",
    "- There is almost nothing to note in terms of premises vs day of week or hour of day. Education is lower on the weekend and at night, obviously, but that's about it. Private residence higher on weekends and evening/night.\n",
    "- Top 3 most dangerous areas are 77th Street, Southwest and Southeast. Doesn't appear to be a pattern across the week - no areas stand out as more dangerous on a particular day. Area vs descent does seem to differ, but this is likely because of neighbourhoods where different demographics live (e.g. West LA has a disproportionate number of white child victims, but it's a very white area relatively)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualisations:**\n",
    "- NB heatmap: area pins are centroids to average lat and lon."
